## Node/Express CRUD API that stores data in a SQLite database using the Sequelize ORM
<br> <br> 

- in this project I built a CRUD API which allows a client to add, delete, edit and get flashcards

<br> 

- these flashcards can be saved in an SQLite database,

<br> 

- in order to avoid the need to create SQL statements such as CREATE TABLE, SELECT, INSERT INTO, DELETE and UPDATE, I used an Sequelize which simplies this work for me.
